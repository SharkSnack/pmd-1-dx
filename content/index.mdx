This is a wiki for Pokemon Mystery Dungeon: Rescue Team DX for the Nintendo Switch.<br/>It's a work-in-progress, so some pages don't have content yet, and others may change in time.

If you spot any errors or wish to contribute, please join the community [Discord server](https://discord.gg/5y7UDFc) and ping shark.

A significant portion of the information found on this site is hand-translated from the [Japanese wiki](https://wikiwiki.jp/pokemysdundx/),<br/>along with information others found through datamining + some information from Serebii and Bulbapedia.<br/>The goal of this site is to organize things into one spot so information is easier to access.
