# Overview

- Traps are found on the ground and activate when stepped on.
    - They generally apply a negative effect, but some can be utilized to your advantage.
- Most traps are normally hidden, and are revealed when you step on them or do a trap check (R + A) near them.
    - They become visible if you eat an <span class="itemIcon"><img src="../images/items/eyedrop_seed.png"/></span>Eyedrop Seed, equip <span class="itemIcon"><img src="../images/items/goggle_specs.png"/></span>Goggle Specs, or use a <span class="itemIcon"><img src="../images/items/see_trap_orb.png"/></span>See-Trap Orb.
    - Warp Traps needed to escape item islands are always visible.
